### User Stories

[Pivotal Tracker link](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2400279)

### Feature List

A user needs to:
- sign up / Log in
- Create / View / Delete post
- Create / View / Delete comment 
- Create / View / Update comment

### Wireframe

Therefore, we defined the UI as

##### home page

![alt text][home_page]

##### post page

- post page - view all posts owned by user

![alt text][post_view_all]

- post page - view a single post

![alt text][post_view]

- post page - create a post

![alt text][post_create]

##### profile page

![alt text][profile_page]

# Check List (Removed at the end of project)

~~Have placeholders for user login and sign-up (i.e., create basic HTML forms).~~

Have a user directed to a home page that contains all posts once they sign in.

Allow a user to create and delete their own posts, as well as view and comment on others’ posts.

Add front-end Ajax calls to consume the given APIs.

Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

~~Include separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.~~

Stick with the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) and DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles.
