# Approaches Taken:

## 1. Create Mock Drafts of pages to meet business requirements
    -- Developers outlined basic design of an MVP with paper/pencil
    -- Used User Stories as a guide for an MVP
    -- Developers made a preliminary list of Javasript functions and HTML elements necessary to achieve desired UI design
    -- Made Wireframe designs for desired UI
## 2. Pair-Programming, Agile methodlogies, and Extreme Programming Approaches
    -- Constant, daily meetings between developers in person and over Slack
    -- In person, pair programming achieved during User Story creation, app structure design, implementing API calls
    -- Pair programming also achieved when developers had questions about partner code and explanation was required
    -- Extreme Programming achieved with daily stand-ups, basic UI acceptance tests, pair programming, and pair negotiation
    -- Agile methodlogies achieved with over 80 commits on Github and development of multiple, small aspects of MVP daily
    -- Developers worked independently on certain aspects of seperate pages to acheive loose dependancy between files

Post-It functions as a Reddit-like front-end application. It is expected to serve as a forum for users to create accounts, login to their accounts, and create and manage posts, comments, and their profile.

The application structure is defined to be multi-paged. Each Html, CSS, and Javascript file is divided to serve only one page at a time. 

Below is an outline of the project with links to our User Stories created in Pivotal Tracker, Requirements Outline, Feature List, and a preliminary sketch of our UI.


# User Stories and Features 
### User Stories

[Pivotal Tracker link](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2400279)

Main Application Components:

- Sign up / Log in (account management)
- Create / View posts (posts)
- Create / View / Delete comments (comments)
- Create / View / Update profile (profile)

### Function List



###### Home page

- login text area for login function / signup link directing to signup form
- display all posts from server. Users can view and comment on the posts.

###### Post page

- login text area for login function / signup link directing to signup form
- ** if user is not logged in, the page will show error message and hide other contents
- two buttons serve as a switcher to view own posts, or create a new post
- view all posts mode: list all posts sorted by post id, each post has an click listener connected to single view mode
- view one post mode: show one post, comments if any, a comment input area, submit button, and a delete post button
- create a post mode: enter title, post content, and submit

###### Profile page

- login text area for login function / signup link directing to signup form
- ** if user is not logged in, the page will show error message and hide other contents
- If profile is empty and not accessible from the server, the form will be editable
- After entering info, create profile with API call
- If profile is created, display in the page, email and address boxes are grey and read-only, mobile is white and editable for updating profile
- After entering info, update profile with API call

### Wireframe

Therefore, we defined the UI as

##### home page

![alt text][home_page]

##### post page

- post page - view all posts owned by user

![alt text][post_view_all]

- post page - view a single post

![alt text][post_view]

- post page - create a post

![alt text][post_create]

##### profile page

![alt text][profile_page]


# Tech Stack, Methodologies and Principles

### Tech Stack

- HTML for markdown

- CSS for styling and layout

- Javascript for Listners for event handling, DOM manipulation, Communication with backend API, Ajax fetch

### Methodology

Agile Development and Extreme Programming

- pair programming

- fast iterations

- continuous integration

- early deliverable

### Principles

- KISS (keep it simple, stupid)

- DRY (don't repeat yourself) (modularity)

### Application Structure
